# 2021 Robot Software

This repo contains the software for WildStang's 6 (yes you read that right, five) robots from the 2021 robotics season. This year was special due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Infinite Recharge at Home. Our team is very large (> 75 students). In order to provide our students as close to a full FRC build season as possible we devised our own game "Fuel Duel" based on 1992's "Maize Craze" and split the team up into 4 mini-teams. We did this in addition to building a whole new robot for Infinite Recharge at Home. We also competed in off season competitions with our 2020 robot. Since there are 6 different robots, there are 6 different code bases, each of these code bases is in a unique branch.
